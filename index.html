                <h3>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</h3>
                <p>Several friends own Paddy's Pub, a neighborhood bar in Philadelphia, and try to find their way in the world of work and relationships. But often, they can't get out of their own way, leading to uncomfortable situations, which usually worsen before improving. The gang includes twin siblings Dennis and Sweet Dee Reynolds, along with their longtime friends, Charlie Kelly and Ronald "Mac" McDonald. Charlie lives with Frank, Dennis and Sweet Dee's father, who has left his cheating, money-grabbing wife in an attempt to redeem himself after a history of doing business with sketchy people.</p>

                <p>John Oliver won an Emmy for his work as a writer on "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart," but it wasn't until he guest-hosted that show in the summer of 2013 that HBO took notice of his "singular perspective and distinct voice." Thanks to that memorable gig, Oliver gets to show off his talent in front of HBO's camera on "Last Week Tonight." The late-night series sees the British comic review what happened the past seven days in news, politics and current events, all with a heavy dose of satire, of course.</p>

                <h3>The League</h3>
                <p>Avid fantasy football fans try to balance their time between the league and their real lives. It becomes a challenge, though, when the good-natured competition gives way to a win-at-all-costs mentality, which begins to spill over into their relationships and even the workplace. It's a cutthroat competition to win the league -- and the bragging rights that come with the feat. The sitcom features a plethora of cameos by real-life NFL players, who play themselves on the series.</p>
